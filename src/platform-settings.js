  // extremes — someone booking an emergency plumber this afternoon needs a

  // need the provider glued to their phone. A single flat window can't
  // serve both well, so this scales with lead time instead.

// The actual per-booking calculation. Priority order, same fallback-chain
// convention used everywhere else in this app:
//   1. A category-level override (set in Categories & Countries) always
//      wins — e.g. "Emergency Plumbing" might always need a 30-minute
//      response regardless of how far out the job is.
//   2. Otherwise, the tiered default based on how soon the job actually
//      starts (see bookingResponseTiers above).
//   3. Hard floor either way: the deadline can never exceed the job's own
//      start time (confirming a job after it was supposed to start is
//      meaningless) and never drops below 15 minutes (so a same-hour
//      emergency booking still gets a real, if short, window instead of
//      an instantly-expired one).
