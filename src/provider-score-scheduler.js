// page load), and — the real point of this sweep — notifies the
// verification team and the provider's own regional admin the moment a
// score newly crosses into a band worth a human looking at. "Newly"
// matters: this only notifies once per crossing, not every single day
// the score stays low, the same "don't re-notify for something already
// flagged" principle the document-expiry sweep already uses.
//
// The real consequence of a low score is fully automatic and needs no
// admin action at all — see weeklyJobAccessCapForScore in
// ./provider-score, which scales a provider's new-match exposure down as
// their score drops (fully suspended at 0-19), and recovers the moment
// their score does. What this sweep surfaces is different: a recommendation for
// whether a human should actually reach out and help, via a real,
// separate manual action (POST /admin/providers/:id/hold) — which is
// for account holds over real issues like fraud, not a score-triggered
// pause anymore.
